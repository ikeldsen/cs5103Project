Design Change Report:

I did not use any specific design principles when designing and coding this project. I tried to keep it as simple
as possible as that allows for easy ability to read, maintain, and update. In my experience keeping things as simple as
possible is the best approach for long term costs and maintainability.

Design changes with requirement updates:

The first requirements update required my project to add functionality to convert a large number to a string. It noted
the string should have commas after every three digits, so like 23,555,555. My project did not support large numbers so
I changed the variable type to long. (It was later noted this did not support large enough numbers). I simply had to add
functionality to ask at the end of the program if they wanted to convert the number to a string.

The second requirements update required my project to add functionality to allow the numbers to have a decimal point,
specifically one decimal point. To do this I changed the variable to a BigDecimal which supports as large of a number as
the ram or jvm would support. I then allowed input of a decimal and did a validation check to ensure there was only one
decimal place. I also reorganized the code to have smaller methods and be much more readable.
