Code Clone Detection Report:

Steps to run the report ->
Click Analyze -> Inspect Code -> Ok. Look for Duplicate, if you don't see it then there were no duplicates

By running this process it will give you a report if there are any duplicates, it can even attempt to remove the
duplicates for you.
Current report shows zero duplicate lines.

The experience was nice. It gave me a detailed report if anything was found and gave me options to fix the issues.

Static Bug Detection Report:

Click Analyze -> Inspect Code -> Ok. Look for Probable Bugs

There are currently no bugs. When I first ran the report it found one probably bug for assigning a string a value of
empty or "" which didn't need to be done because every possible path assigned a value to the string.

The experience was nice. It gave me a detailed report if anything was found and gave me options to fix the issues.
