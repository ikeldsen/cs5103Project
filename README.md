## How to run the code

1. Clone the project at https://github.com/ikeldsen/cs5103Project
2. Pull down the code in the main branch
3. Navigate to the Calculator.java file
4. Run the main method and follow the prompt in the terminal

## Project Requirements

(a) Specification: Write formal specification of the program you are writing. <br />
(b) Design: Adapt your software design based on new requirements posted every 3 weeks. <br />
(c) Implementation: Implement your code based on version control system and make
changes to implementation based on new requirements.<br />
(d) Testing: Write unit tests for your code.<br />
(e) Tool Application: Apply code clone detection, static bug detection, and test generation
tool on your code base and report results. <br />


### Specifications

1.0 - Provide the ability to add together two numbers, the input and output will both be number types 
that can support large numbers potentially in the millions<br />
1.1 - The numbers will be entered via command line using a prompt<br />

2.0 - Provide the ability to subtract two numbers, the input and output will both be number types
that can support large numbers potentially in the millions<br />
2.1 - The numbers will be entered via command line using a prompt<br />

3.0 - Given the calculation has been performed provide an output feature that allows the 
user to choose to have the output converted from a number array to a string (sequence of char)<br />
3.1 - Add a comma to the resulting string every three characters from the end<br />


4.0 Allow the numbers to have a decimal point of exactly one.
4.1 Align the numbers by the decimal point by adding zeros at the end if a number does not have a decimal point
